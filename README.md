This role will involve working on various AI and automation projects, with the first assignment focused on building a chatbot trained on data from 2,500 products via an API using Flowise and OpenAI.

Responsibilities:

-Develop chatbots and automation tools based on supplied data and business requirements.
-Collaborate on integrating AI into existing systems to improve operational efficiency and user experience.
-Work with Flowise or N8N to build seamless automation workflows.
-Train team on flowise and n8n where required.

Requirements:

-Proven experience with Flowise or N8N in chatbot development and automation projects.
-Ability to work proactively and bring creative solutions to AI and automation challenges.
-Strong knowledge of AI technologies and APIs, especially OpenAI.
-Excellent communication skills and a collaborative mindset.
-Availability and regular communication is must.
======
To meet the requirements of this project, here’s an implementation plan using Python along with Flowise and OpenAI API. Below, I outline how to create a chatbot and automation workflow while leveraging the tools specified.
Steps for Implementation

    Data Preparation:
        Fetch the product data from the provided API and preprocess it for chatbot training.
        Structure the data into formats suitable for Flowise workflows or OpenAI fine-tuning.

    Setting Up Environment:
        Install dependencies for Flowise and N8N.
        Use Python to integrate APIs and build automated workflows.

    Chatbot Development:
        Train the chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT models.
        Configure Flowise for seamless interaction with APIs and product data.

    Automation Workflow with Flowise or N8N:
        Automate tasks like data retrieval, user queries, and response delivery.

    Testing and Deployment:
        Test workflows and chatbot responses for accuracy and efficiency.
        Deploy the solution to production.

    Documentation and Training:
        Document the workflows and provide training for using Flowise and N8N.

Python Code Snippets
Install Required Libraries

pip install openai requests json

Fetch Product Data

import requests

API_URL = "https://api.example.com/products"
API_KEY = "your_api_key"

def fetch_product_data():
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.get(API_URL, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Assuming the API returns JSON data
    else:
        print("Error fetching data:", response.status_code)
        return None

product_data = fetch_product_data()
print(f"Fetched {len(product_data)} products.")

Train OpenAI Model

import openai

openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

def generate_chatbot_response(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# Example usage
user_prompt = "Tell me about product X"
bot_response = generate_chatbot_response(user_prompt)
print("Chatbot Response:", bot_response)

Automate Workflow Using Flowise

For Flowise, you would typically use its visual interface to design workflows, but you can also integrate it programmatically.

import requests

FLOWISE_API_URL = "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/flows"

def trigger_flowise_workflow(flow_id, input_data):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{FLOWISE_API_URL}/{flow_id}/execute",
        json=input_data
    )
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print("Error executing workflow:", response.status_code)
        return None

workflow_id = "your_flow_id"
input_payload = {"query": "Product details about Y"}
output = trigger_flowise_workflow(workflow_id, input_payload)
print("Workflow Output:", output)

Automate Workflow Using N8N

For N8N, you can call the workflows using webhooks.

N8N_WEBHOOK_URL = "http://localhost:5678/webhook/test"

def trigger_n8n_workflow(payload):
    response = requests.post(N8N_WEBHOOK_URL, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print("Error triggering N8N workflow:", response.status_code)
        return None

n8n_payload = {"action": "fetch_product_info", "product_id": "12345"}
n8n_output = trigger_n8n_workflow(n8n_payload)
print("N8N Workflow Output:", n8n_output)

Final Steps

    Testing: Validate chatbot responses and workflow accuracy using sample queries.

    Documentation: Create a guide on how to modify and use the workflows.

    Training: Conduct sessions for the team to familiarize them with Flowise and N8N.

This code provides a modular, extensible foundation for developing the requested chatbot and automation workflows.
